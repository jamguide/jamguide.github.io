# Jam Guide
### Organize the songs you know or need to learn for practice through performance.

When you sit down to practice, do you have a plan?

When it's your turn to call a tune at a jam session, how's your recall?

When you are rehearsing with your band, how often do you hear "who's got the set list"?

Personally, I need a list and most of the time, I don't have it on me.  But, I always have my phone.

## Jam Guide can help you and your musical friends get organized.
